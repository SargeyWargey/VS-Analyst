## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions Made

### Core Integration Strategy
1. **Native VS Code Integration** - Embed documentation features directly into VS Code core rather than as extension
2. **Service-Oriented Architecture** - Platform services with dependency injection for scalability
3. **Progressive Enhancement** - Lazy loading and background processing for optimal performance
4. **Enterprise-First Design** - Built-in multi-tenancy, security, and governance features

### Technology Stack Decisions
1. **Platform Services** - Leverage VS Code's platform service layer for deep integration
2. **Native DOM Rendering** - Replace webviews with native panels for performance
3. **Background Workers** - CPU-intensive analysis in dedicated worker threads
4. **Multi-level Caching** - Memory, IndexedDB, and file system caching strategy

### User Experience Decisions
1. **Analyst-Focused UI** - Purpose-built interface optimizing documentation workflows
2. **Template-Driven Approach** - Standardized, customizable templates for consistency
3. **AI-Integrated Experience** - Claude Code Pro seamlessly woven throughout workflows
4. **Progressive Disclosure** - Advanced features available but not overwhelming to new users

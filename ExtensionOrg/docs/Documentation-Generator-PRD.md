# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Documentation Generator VS Code Extension

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** September 19, 2025
**Author:** Solution Architecture Team
**Status:** Draft

---

## Executive Summary

The Documentation Generator Extension is a VS Code extension that automates the creation of high-quality technical documentation by leveraging Claude Code Pro. It enables solution architects, developers, and technical writers to generate context-aware documentation through one-click folder selection and template-based generation.

### Key Value Proposition
- **60% reduction** in documentation creation time
- **Consistent formatting** across all team documentation
- **Context-aware content** generated from actual codebase analysis
- **Zero API costs** by leveraging existing Claude Code Pro subscriptions

---

## Problem Statement

### Current Pain Points
1. **Manual Documentation Creation**: Team members spend 3-5 hours weekly creating documentation manually
2. **Inconsistent Formatting**: Documentation varies widely in structure and quality across team members
3. **Context Switching**: Moving between code analysis, research, and writing disrupts development flow
4. **Outdated Documentation**: Manual processes lead to documentation that quickly becomes stale
5. **Knowledge Silos**: Different team members use different approaches and templates

### Business Impact
- **Lost Productivity**: 15-20 hours/week across team spent on manual documentation
- **Poor User Experience**: Inconsistent documentation confuses end users and new team members
- **Delayed Onboarding**: New team members struggle without standardized documentation
- **Technical Debt**: Undocumented features become maintenance burdens
